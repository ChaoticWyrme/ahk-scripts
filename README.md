# ahk-scripts
A collection of useful autohotkey scripts that I made to help automate some things.

The main one right now is the CapsLockRemap, which remaps CapsLock to the Escape or Control keys and is controlled by a submenu in the tray menu. 


## Loading on startup
To load the scripts on startup, simply create a shortcut to autostart.ahk, and place it in the Startup folder under one of the Start Menu folders. These can be found under `C://ProgramData`, or in `AppData/Roaming`, in `Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup`.
